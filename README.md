# Drafloon
Draft Automation Bot

- Purpose is expediate the draft process and automate left picks and skipping.

## Plan
### Discord Bot (what information to store)
- Link a trades channel with its corresponding spreadsheet
- Command to link a user to a specific team/roster
- Update when more things need to be stored
- List of Pokemon

### Discord Bot (player commands and functionality)
- Add the ability to draft and leave picks
  - For leaving picks we can start with a ranked system that goes to the next one if it is taken
  - We can add more specific functionality in case something is sniped or taken
  - Can possibly do it with an app but this would be significantly more implementation time (I also only have a 1 cpu server, so I want to limit commands)

### Google Sheets
- Only needs access to the roster page
- Possibly allow people to update their own logos and teamNames
